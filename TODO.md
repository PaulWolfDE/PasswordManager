# TODOs

~~-Every file is saved in another app data file during first open. One can choose recently opened files later in a combo box at startup of the password manager. Separate file to `.pmrc`. On every startup, files that don't exist anymore are being removed from the file and not loaded.
    - File name _could_ be something like `.pmro` (Password manager recently opened)~~

(Including option to perform a one-time pad on database)

Pack database before encryption (only suitable for large databases)

Advanced password generation

Add possibility to play Tetris
